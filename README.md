# Instructions:
This program was developed with a Linux environment in mind (particularly, Ubuntu 18, but it should work with other Linux distros).  
It was compiled with GCC 7.5.0, but it should work with other GCC compilers because it is ANSI C compliant.  
## Build
After cloning the repo, simply run  
```make all```

## Run
First, run the server:  
```make server_test```  
Then, open up several Bash instances and in each one run:  
```make client_test```  
You can change the maximum number of users in the `MAX_USERS` macro in `server.c`.  
  
**NOTE:** You can also run this in serveral separate computers, with a few caveats. If you wish to run this with several computers connected to the same LAN, simply change the client's `SERVER_ADDR` macro in `network_utils.h` to the IP address of the server computer. To achieve the same effect on different computers, it should suffice to perform the same steps after opening the corresponding port on the server's modem, but this has not been tested. If this distributed approach is used, it is not required to run `make server_test` on the client machines.


## Usage  
Upon starting the client program, you are able to change the server connection settings (meaning the IPv4 address and port number), change your nickname and connect to the server.  
The commands to do this are  
```/connect - Connects to the server```  
```/server <IPv4> <port> - Change server connection settings```  
```/nickname <nickname> - Change your current nickname```  
  
Once you are connected to the server, you can send messages to all other connected clients just by typing in the terminal. The available commands are  
```/nickname <new name> - Change your nickname```  
```/ping - Check connection to server```  
```/quit - Exit the server (CTRL+D also terminates the application)```
